Together with in60seconds and getting the picture, we will be creating a new dashboard containing data from www.cbs.com, 
giving people a clear insight on what is happening in the country.

Our main objectives are
* making the data accessible and understandable for everyone
* creating a visually stimulating environment that makes the reader curious
* using data visualisations to inform the user
